# To load structure 
# Search structure from RCSB PDB (https://www.rcsb.org/) and obtain ID (short 4 alphanumerical like 1D5R)
# on pymol command line
fetch 1D5R

# Coloring structure according to user spec
# Create file with one column of values (one value for each amino acid)
# ex: generating file in rstudio
#summarySE to condense all abundance scores for each position into single mean
pten_pymol <- summarySE(pten1_data, measurevar="score", groupvars="position", na.rm=TRUE)
#score[404] is wt
write.table(pten_pymol$score[1:403], "newBFactors.txt", sep="\n", row.names=F, col.names=F, na = "NaN")

inFile = open("newBFactors.txt", 'r')

# create the global, stored array
newB = []

# read the new B factors from file
for line in inFile.readlines(): newB.append(float(line))

# close the input file
inFile.close()

# clear out the old B Factors
alter 1D5R, b=0.0

# update the B Factors with new properties
alter 1D5R and n. CA, b=newB.pop(0)

# color the protein based on the new B Factors of the alpha carbons
cmd.spectrum("b", "1D5R and n. CA")
